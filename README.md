# Project-MATLAB

## MATLAB Controller Projects:

1. **Blending Tank Controller** - Control a physical plant via manual and automatic control using an HMI and PLC Controller. The plant contains 4 inlet valves, an outlet valve and a stirrer.
2. **Differential Drive Robot Controller** - Research in Differential Drive Non-Holonomic Robots by modeling and controlling the system in MATLAB Simulink using 2 controllers: The Linear Quadratic Regulator and the State-Feedback via Pole Placement.
3. **Plant Model Controller** - Design and simulation of an Ultra-Pure Demineralized Sea Water Reverse Osmosis Treatment Plant for a 5GW Combined Cycle Power Plant for Trinidad and Tobago
